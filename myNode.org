** 在.emacs中加（setq command-line-default-directory "/your path/")
*** (setq default-directory "/your path") ]有效果
*** The directory that appears in the prompt for C-x C-f ('find-file') comes from the value of default-directory,
which is a buffer-local variable. When you first start Emacs, the initial buffer displayed is the GNU Emacs buffer.
 That buffer's default-directory is set from the variable command-line-default-directory.
